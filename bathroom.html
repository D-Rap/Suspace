  <h2> Shampoo bars </h2>
    <p>Did you know you can reduce the amount of plastic waste you produce massively, simply by replacing your shampoo and conditioner plastic bottles with shampoo and conditioner bars?
    Lots of brands now make their own, also using natural products that are kinder to your skin as well as the environment </p>
  <h2> Double edge safety razors </h2>
    <p> You don't have to give up shaving to be plastic free! Just get yourself a double-edge safety razor instead of your disposable razors. Purchase one today too! </p>
  <h2> Menstrual Cup & Washable Pads</h2>
     <p> Did you know that on average, women use on average 11,250 single-use disposable tampons or pads and spend on average £4,800 over their lifetime?
         If this seems a little absurd and unfair to you too, there is a solution... Menstrual cups are made of flexible medical grade silicone and shaped like a bell with a stem, which, unlike tampons you can keep inside for up to 12 hours and when you remove it, you simply wash it or put it in boiling water to disinfect it. It takes a little getting used to, but it is definitely worth it (so did tampons though at first?)! It is normally sold online and in most farmacies for between £10-20</p>
     <p> If this doesn't appeal to you, then you can also purchase reusable pads, made in soft fabric which is often much kinder to your skin than normal disposable pads. Just throw them in the washing machine with your other clothes! </p>
