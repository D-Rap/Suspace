  <h2> What is zero waste? </h2>
    <div id="overflowTest">
    Simply put, it is the aim to send nothing to a landfill by reducing what we 'need', reusing and upcycling as much as possible, sending little to be recycled, while the rest that we throw away we should compost.
    It's really about redefining the system. We currently live in a linear economy where we take resources from the earth and then dump them in a giant hole in the ground. The goal of zero waste is to move to a circular economy where trash won't exist. The circular economy mimics nature: there is no trash in nature.

  <h2> What's wrong with landfills? </h2>
    <div id="overflowTest">
    We consume too many resources at an incredibly fast rate, for it to be sustainable. This means that the impacts we have on the environment and the ecosystem are too great to make it possible for nature to be 'cured'
    </div>

  <h2> Can we not just recylcle everything, then?</h2>
    <div id="overflowTest">
      Unfortunately not, There's simply too much to process, and we're just consuming way too much. Recycling isn't a perfect solution. While it plays into the solution, we have to lessen our dependence. Did you know, only 9% of plastic is actually recycled?
        Recycling should be our last resort, not our first go-to.
